**Message Encription:** 
 Cryptography is the science of secret codes. Previously we used DES algorithms in order to secure but cannot encrypt completely. Thus, we referred AES Algorithms to create a ciphertext in encryption and is given as an input in decryption. In present scenario, everyone sharing their data in online using internet also online transactions like e-banking for money transfers, in shopping malls, restaurants, and many more. While transferring a huge amount or any confidential data there are many chances to hack the data. Encryption is one the most effective approach to achieve data security and privacy. The Encryption techniques hide the original content of a data in such a way that the original information is recovered only through using a key known as decryption process. The objective of the encryption is to secure or protect data from unauthorized access in term of viewing or modifying the data. Encryption can be implemented occurs by using some substitute technique, shifting technique, or mathematical operations. Several symmetric key base algorithms have been developed in the past year. In paper an efficient reliable symmetric key based algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the text data has proposed.  Send a quick message with simple text encryption to your WhatsApp contact and , basically in ROT13 with new multi encryption based algorithm on Symbols Substitution and ASCII. The other half-design here is to encrypt and decrypt any form of data in any given format based on 256 bit AES algorithm in OFB mode. The proposed method is easy to implement.
